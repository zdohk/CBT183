PLEASE REFERENCE MEMBER STEMEDI# IN THIS PDS !!!!!

Hello Mr. Golob,

For many years the CBT tape has been a great help for me. Usually
I used the programs 'as is', but now a colleague wants a way to
show him all the stem variables in a REXX exec.  OK, there's
STEMEDIT in CBT tape file 183, but this can only be used for stem
variables like a.1, a.2 and so on.  One big advantage of REXX is,
that you can use stem variables in the way like a. =0;do i=1 to
words(text);j=WORD(text,i);a.j=a.j+1;end . So you can count how
many times a word is used in a text.  For such stem variables you
can't use STEMEDIT.  So I changed STEMEDIT to VIEW and EDIT all
variables in a REXX exec.  You'll find the changed source in the
zip file I attached to this eMail.

There are also two edit macros to be used with STEMEDIT.  Call
STEMEMCB at the beginning of the edit session to change all '00'x
in blanks and shift the '=' to the left.  At the end of the edit
session STEMEMCE should be called to end up the lines with '00'x.
I've also changed TALLY to work under z/OS 1.13.  I know you don't
need TALLY anymore, because DSLIST now can do this for you.  But
the idea behind TALLY is, to find the ISPF table used by DSLIST
and use it for your own needs.  So I wrote DSL as an example, how
to use this table.  In DSL you can exclude Datasets from the list,
flip between excluded and visible and do HSM RECALL for all
visible Datasets.  I hope these programs will be a help for someone.

Thank you for your help and work for so many years.
