IKJEFLN2 is a TSO LOGON exit routine which can be coded to reconnect
a user to an active TSO session.  IBM provides the rules for system
programmers to write such an exit routine, but (as far as I know),
does not distribute a coding example.

In 2000, I wrote a free version of IKJEFLN2 which soon was
distributed in file 183 of the CBT tape and quickly became
popular.  In 2002, however, it started to stop working on z/OS
systems, because the rules with which RACF handles OPERCMDS had
become more restrictive.  When the free IKJEFLN2 exit fails,
these messages are produced:

  IEE345I VARY     AUTHORITY INVALID, FAILED BY SECURITY PRODUCT
  ICH408I JOB(MSTJCL00) STEP(BPXOINIT) MVS.VARY.NET CL(OPERCMDS)
    INSUFFICIENT ACCESS AUTHORITY
    ACCESS INTENT(UPDATE) ACCESS ALLOWED(NONE)

I received several suggestions to correct the problem, but I also
had personal experience that convinced me to add new capabilities
to the exit routine.  For this reason, I wrote the IKJEFLN2 product
which no longer had the above OPERCMDS problem and today, works
fine in z/OS R9 with RACF.

Compared to the free version, the IKJEFLN2 product has additional
capabilities.  It displays information about (1) the active TSO
session and (2) the new TSO session just created, then prompts the
user to (1) reconnect to the active TSO session, or (2) cancel it.

The IKJEFLN2 product also checks for an IEF238D allocation
recovery message.  If it finds one that blocks the TSO session,
it automatically replies CANCEL to it.

The IKJEFLN2 product is very inexpensive and described here:
