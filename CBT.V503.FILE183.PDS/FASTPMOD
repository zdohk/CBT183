      Modifying ISPF Command Table Entries Generated by FASTPATH
      --------- ---- ------- ----- ------- --------- -- --------

I hope this little explanation will help you to better use FASTPATH,
and you can make sure that none of its generated commands will get
in your way.

Please let it be known that the FASTPATH command adds a lot of entries
to the ISPF command table.  These commands may not be the way you want
them to be.  For example, the UTIL command to invoke the ISRUTIL panel
can be abbreviated to 2 characters, or UT.  Entering UT on a command
line will then invoke panel ISRUTIL.

People who use the PDS 8.6 command from CBT File 182, will not like
this setting, because UT as a PDS command will invoke the PDS utility
panels, and you won't want the IBM ISRUTIL panel always getting in the
way.

So how do you fix it?  You have to assemble the FASTPATH program after
changing appropriate entries in the ISPCMDS CSECT.  What do you do?
The following is an example:

You want to change:  (for example)

UTIL     2   SELECT PGM(FASTPATH) PARM(UTIL,&ZPARM)   Fast Path Command

to

UTIL     4   SELECT PGM(FASTPATH) PARM(UTIL,&ZPARM)   Fast Path Command

to eliminate the abbreviation to 2 characters.  Or you might want
an abbreviation to 3 characters, or 0 characters.

So what do you do?

Go to the assembler source code for FASTPATH and look for the ISPCMDS
CSECT in column 1.  Then look for the proper command entry, as follows:

*
         ISPCMDS VERB=UTIL,                                            X
               TRUNC=2,                                                X
               ACT='SELECT PGM(FASTPATH) PARM(UTIL,&&ZPARM)',          X
               DESC='Fast Path Command: PDF Utilities'


which you will then modify to taste, for example:

*
         ISPCMDS VERB=UTIL,                                            X
               TRUNC=4,                                                X
               ACT='SELECT PGM(FASTPATH) PARM(UTIL,&&ZPARM)',          X
               DESC='Fast Path Command: PDF Utilities'

and then you reassemble FASTPATH.  Remember to modify the linkedit JCL
in the middle of the source code.  Look for // in column 1 and scroll
back upward one screen, to find it.

I hope this little explanation will help you to better use FASTPATH,
and you can make sure that none of its generated commands will get
in your way.

All the best of everything to all of you.
