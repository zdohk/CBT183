I looked at Gilbert's work on my z/OS 1.13 system which he had been
using.  He invoked FASTPATH from his LOGON CLIST by executing the
command (at the end of the CLIST):

PDF PGM(FASTPATH)

and this worked.  Previously, I tried invoking FASTPATH by saying:

TSO CALL 'library.name(FASTPATH)' and got the following error
messages:

IKJ56612I IKJURPS processing ended due to error.  RC=20 ERROR=23

(Sometimes this message comes up, but FASTPATH still loads.  I
also invoked FASTPATH with an ISPF SELECT statement as follows:

SELECT PGM(FASTPATH)

which seems to work ok, as well.)

So it seems that on a z/OS 1.12 system (or similar level) you
should do what Gilbert himself did.

Previous to my having tried FASTPATH, I have always updated my ISPF
command table using a package of REXX execs on CBT File 349, from
Willy Jensen.  The ISPCMDL exec from this collection is useful for
checking on the status of your ISPF command table entries, and I am
therefore including it here.  While having done that, I also copied
the ISPCMDU (table updater) exec, and my ISPCOMND data member.  So
you have Willy Jensen's package here too.  In any case, ISPCMDL can
always be used to check on whether FASTPATH has done its work.

I am a very frequent user of the "PDS command package" from CBT File
182.  This package has a subcommand called LC which lists datasets
according to catalog.  And of course, Gilbert's "LC" which stands
for his LCAT program, conflicts with this.

So I changed "LC" in FASTPATH to "LCA".  Sorry.  Gilbert isn't
using this himself (I wish he were), and I figure that there are
so many users of the PDS command out there, that it now outweighs
the ones who use LC for LCAT.  So they'll have to use "LCA" now.

   HOW TO CHANGE THE GENERATED COMMAND TABLE ENTRIES......
