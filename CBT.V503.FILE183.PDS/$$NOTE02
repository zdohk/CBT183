Sam,
  IBM broke Gilbert's SWAREQ exec at z/OS 2.2 by moving a control
  block above the bar. We use this as a basis for an IPCS REXX
  exec we use, so I researched what would be needed to fix it.
  Here's what I came up with:  (see member SWAREQ22 for the REXX)


I tested this on our 2.2 system. Of course, no guarantees as the
QMAT is OCO.
