@  The%CUT@command is used to copy one or more lines of the data being edited
   to a clip-board from which it can later be retrieved using the%PASTE@
   command.  The clip-boards are erased when you logoff.

   To specify the lines to be put into the clip-board, use line commands%C@or
  %CC@to copy line(s), or%M@or%MM@to move lines, or use%labels@.  If you do
   not specify a line command or labels, then%ALL@of the lines are copied to
   the clip-board.

   If you specify a%clip-board@name as part of the command, you can use multiple
   clip-boards, each of which you can later refer to with the%PASTE@ command.
   A clip-board names has the same format as a PDS member name.  If you specify
   a + sign instead of a clip-board name, the data is appended to the default
   clip-board.
