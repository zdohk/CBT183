Gilbert Saint-flour has unfortunately passed on.  His "for sale"
vendor products are being managed by a group of his friends for
the benefit of his family.  His free products (for example his
stuff on this file (File 183) of the CBT Tape collection) are being
managed by Sam Golob (sbgolob@cbttape.org or sbgolob@att.net).

Inquiries should now be directed to Sam Golob.

   email:  sbgolob@cbttape.org   or   sbgolob@att.net

Inquiries for Gilbert's "pay" products should be directed to:
