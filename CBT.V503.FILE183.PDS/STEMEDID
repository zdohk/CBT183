STEMEDIT.DOC

Many times when writing an ISPF dialog in REXX there is a need to
present data to the user. The lazy way is to use the say command,
or write code to write the data to a dataset and then invoke an
ISPF service to Browse, Edit, or View it.  If the data is only
temporary then a better option would be to use the data that
resides in a REXX STEM and that is what STEMEDIT is designed to do.

=====================================================================


STEMEDIT ISPF REXX Command

The STEMEDIT routine can be invoked by a REXX EXEC to display the
contents of stem variables using the ISPF BRIF, VIIF or EDIT
services.  STEMEDIT is a nice complement to the REXX OUTTRAP
function, when it is used in the ISPF/PDF environment.

STEMEDIT can also PULL lines from the data stack instead of using
stem variables.  This only works with EDIT or VIEW, i.e. not with
BROWSE.

The author is Gilbert Saint-Flour and the code is available on the
CBT TAPE (www.cbttape.org) as a great example of the z/OS Open Source
community.  (File 183)

The syntax is:

   CALL STEMEDIT  service,
                  stemname
                  <,firstelem>
                  <,stemcount>
                  <,title>
                  <,panel>
                  <,lrecl>
                  <,recfm>
                  <,profile>
                  <,varl>

Parameters:

  SERVICE

  This argument must be coded as 'BROWSE', 'VIEW' or 'EDIT'.  It
  indicates which of the BRIF, VIIF or EDIF services will be used
  for display.

  If the BROWSE service is requested, the user can enter the V
  commands on the BROWSE screen to switch to VIEW.  This allows the
  data to be saved using CREATE/REPLACE, CUT or ROUTE.

  STEMNAME

  The stem of the family of variables to display.  The combined
  lengths of the stemname argument and the largest subscript (plus
  the period, if specified) cannot exceed 80 characters.  If
  stemname is a true REXX stem, code a period as the last character.
  If you do not specify the period, the subscripts will be
  concatenated to the stem name without an intervening period.  For
  example, if you specify a stemname of "ABC.", STEMEDIT will look
  for variables of the form "ABC.1", "ABC.2", etc. If you specify a
  stemname of "XYZ" (no period), STEMEDIT will look for variables of
  the form "XYZ1", "XYZ2", etc.

  If the service is coded as "VIEW" or "EDIT" and stemname is
  omitted, STEMEDIT PULLs lines from the stack.

  If the service is coded as "VIEW" or "EDIT" the stemname can be
  coded as "*", which will display all variables in the REXX
  variable pool.  Variable names will be shown with 39 characters,
  except you code varl as "L", showing variable names with 255
  characters. If variable name is longer, it will be abbreviated to
  38 or 254 characters and suffixed with "*". Last variable is
  always the contents of VARNAME from this program.  If the service
  is coded as "EDIT" and stemname is coded as "*", variables can be
  edited. It must be coded with variable name beginning in column 1,
  some blanks end with "=" and immediately followed by the value,
  which must be ended with "00"x. You can also drop a variable or a
  stem by coding "DROP variablename" at the beginning of the line
  and end it with "00"x.  Variable name can have a length up to 250.

  FIRSTELEM

  The element of the pseudo-array to begin the display on.  The
  default value is element 1.

  STEMCOUNT

  The number of elements to display.  If you do not specify
  stemcount, STEMEDIT will display variables beginning with
  firstelem, and continuing until an un-initialized variable is
  found (i.e., a variable which has its name for a value).

  TITLE

  An arbitrary character string which identifies the data which is
  being displayed.  The maximum length of this string is 54
  characters.

  PANEL

  A 1 to 8 character name of the panel member to use for the
  display.  The default panel is ISRBROBA for BROWSE and ISREDDE2
  for VIEW and EDIT.

  LRECL

  The record length that should be passed to the BRIF, VIIF or EDIF
  services.  The default value is 255.

  RECFM

  The record format that should be passed to the BRIF, VIIF or EDIF
  services.  Possible values are F, FA, FM, V, VA, VM, or U.  The
  default value is V.

  PROFILE

  The 8-char name of the profile that should be used by VIIF and
  EDIF when the VIEW or EDIT services are requested.  The default
  value is TEXT.

  VARL

  Form of the variable list, if varname is *.  Can be S for short
  (=39 char) or L for long (=255 char) varnames.

EXAMPLES

    Call the STEMEDIT routine to display the output of the
    TSO "LISTCAT" command.  The variables to display
    begin with the characters "LINE.":

       CALL OUTTRAP 'LINE.'
       "LISTCAT"
       CALL STEMEDIT 'BROWSE','LINE.',,,'List Catalog'

    QUEUE JCL to the data stack and call the STEMEDIT
    routine to VIEW it:

       "MAKEBUF"
       QUEUE '//MYJOB JOB 12345,CLASS=A'
       QUEUE '//STEP2 EXEC PGM=IEFBR14'
       CALL STEMEDIT 'VIEW',,,,'Sample JCL'
       "DROPBUF"

RETURN CODES

    The STEMEDIT function returns a return code that indicates
    whether the display worked.  The returned value is
    contained in the RC special variable.

    The following STEMEDIT return code values are possible:

    0    The display was successful.

    4    There were no stems matching the description given in
         stemname (BROWSE).  The data was not modified (EDIT).

    8    Option incompatible with requested service.

    12   Invalid Service requested.

    16   BRIF, VIIF or EDIF failed.

USAGE NOTES

    The EDIT service only works with a stem variable.  If the
    data is modified by the user, STEMEDIT DROPs the stem
    variable, sets stem.0 to the number of records written,
    copies records to the stem.1 through stem.n where n is
    equal to the value of the stem.0 variable, and sets the
    RC variable to 0.  If the data is not modified by the
    user, STEMEDIT sets the RC variable to 4.

COMPATIBILITY

    STEMEDIT has been designed to be compatible with
    the STEMDISP function of the REXXTOOLS product from
    Open Software Technologies, with the following
    exceptions:

    1. STEMEDIT supports the BROWSE, VIEW and EDIT services
       (STEMDISP only supports BROWSE).

    2. If stemcount is not specified, STEMEDIT scans
       variables until an uninitialized variable is found.
       (STEMDISP stops after 100000 variables).

    3. STEMEDIT has the ability to retrieve data from a
       stem variable or the data stack (STEMDISP can only
       retrieve data from a stem variable).
