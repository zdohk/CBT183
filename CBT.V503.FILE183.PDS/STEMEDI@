Notes concerning STEMEDIT......

Please reference CBT Tape File 895 from Rainer Nowak, which contains,
among other things, and extension to the STEMEDIT program to increase
its utility.  The entire File 895 is copied here, as member STEMEDI#,
so that if you only have this file, and not File 895, you can still
access these materials.
